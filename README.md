- 08/21/2023: Drawing PR curves was modified to compare to the same training steps.
  
  - This image below is pr curves I said.

- 08/21/2023 ~ 08/22/2023: I have found some gloves tracking hand to extract skeleton data. - <b><a href="https://github.com/dalabdgw/Experimental_Results/blob/main/Hand%20Landmark%20Detection/YeongminKo/The%20finger%20tracking%20device.pdf">summary</a></b>
- 08/23/2023: I have found some paper regarding person identification about face recognition or face verification, etc through Google Scholar and I summarized that. - <b><a href="https://github.com/dalabdgw/Experimental_Results/blob/main/Person%20Identification/Yeongmin%20Ko/summary%20on%20Person%20Identification.pdf">summary</a></b>
